# Youtube Mockup
This mockup of a video page on Youtube was developed as part of The Odin Project's [Ruby on Rails Curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com) as practice for embedding links and outside resources in to a given page, as well as for experimenting more with HTML and CSS.

The page can be viewed [here](https://naomiflagg.github.io/youtube-mockup/).
